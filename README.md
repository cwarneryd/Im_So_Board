# I'm So Board
## 2.00b Final Toy Product, 2020
### Introduction
This is my final product for my toy design class, 2.00b, which was re-structured to be a remote design challenge
after students were kicked off campus due to Coronavirus. Each student was shipped a kit of materials (plus a $20 giftcard) and tasked with creating a toy that would entertain the people quarantined with them on "their island." Embracing this theme, I decided to create a toy that could be played while watching Zoom lectures - a tedious part of my daily routine when classes became virtualized.
### Game Details
I'm So Board is a game console that combines two competitive, two-player games designed to be played while watching Zoom lectures.
