# I'm So Board
## 2.00b Final Toy Product, 2020
### Introduction
This is my final product for my toy design class, 2.00b, which was re-structured to be a remote design challenge
after students were kicked off campus due to Coronavirus. Each student was shipped a kit of materials (plus a $20 giftcard) and tasked with creating a toy that would entertain the people quarantined with them on "their island." Embracing this theme, I decided to create a toy that could be played while watching Zoom lectures - a tedious part of my daily routine when classes became virtualized.
### Game Overview
I'm So Board is a wireless game console that combines two competitive, two-player games designed to be played while watching Zoom lectures. The first game, Simon 2.0, is a twist on the classic memory game Simon, but with two colors and two players competing to see who fails first! The second game, Word Nerd, is a twist on a drinking game, where each player races to hear the most words mentioned in their lecture.
### Toy Specifications
I'm So Board runs on an Arduino Uno. The two boards communicate wirelessly via NRF24L01 chips. Individual single-color LEDs light up to portray a pattern in Simon and are connected to buttons for the purpose of repeating the pattern. Each board also includes two additional buttons for controlling game aspects in Word Nerd. I also used two different screens (did not have access to two of the same kind) â€“ a Monochrome 128x32 12C OLED graphic display and an LCD display. 
The games were designed for a board  (design below) Read below for details on the specifics of each game and how to run them!
